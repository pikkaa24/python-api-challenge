WeatherPy pulls a random list of cities and gathers weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API. It pulls the coordinates and current weather condition like max temp, cloudiness, and humidity. It plots these condition vs latitude to test correlation.

VactionPy takes the data from WeatherPy to narrow down to cities best for ideal vacation weather.
